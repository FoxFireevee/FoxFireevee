Hello! My name is Hailey Murphy, and I am a Software Engineer, an artist, and an entrepreneur. 
  As a young teenager in school I found my passion very quickly, and I knew I would persue the efforts in anyway that I can. I took advantage of every learning opportunity that I could, and worked hard to get good results.
  As I continued down my path as an artist I quickly realized the power in the coding world. Not to mention how vital it can be in so many aspects of the world around me and my world directly. I try everyday to learn and grow my knowledge and experience.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an elaborate random character generator. As an indecisive artist I struggle with always choosing a character to draw. I love random generators, something to give me a challenge. However there is never a detailed generator, it might generate one or two things, like short elf, or combine Donald Duck and Deadpool. Fun and quirky but way too simple. I am creating I hope the most detailed random character generator out there, where every character you create is garunteed to be different from the last or the hundreds before it. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently completing BloomTech's Full Stack Web Dev program to gain as much knowledge as possible in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m currently collaorating with my boyfriend on some personal project I plan to bring into the coding world, but with the work I make being so complex and detailed there is a lot of work to do before those hit the coding docs.

- âš¡ Fun fact: My passion is in creating deeply layered and detailed fantasy worlds, primarily used in Table Top Role Play Games. I aim to make these worlds interactive and playable with friends via online or in person using all the tools in my bag to make it happen.
